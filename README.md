# Net 8 Core Api - Boilerplate (with built in auto-discover DI)


## What ?

A `.Net 8 API` project which includes:

- Autodiscover services - I have created neat auto-discover extension method that will find and inject all of our services that are implementing `IService` interface (e.g. `IBlogService : IService` )
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity` that is managing users and is using `JSON Web Token (JWT)` for auth. It is based on `Identity Server`, and you can easily change it to use `Identity Server` instead (see `AuthenticationHelper.cs line 57`).
- I implemented a `Unit-Of-Work pattern` that meets my needs and the needs of the projects I am working on quite well. Keep in mind that this version was written to support the running of stored procedures as well as to run queries in transactions.
- Added usage of `Sequences as primary key` for table. (See the 2nd point in "Why?" below. )
- Modular `CORS` registration
- `NLog` library to do the logging (mainly exceptions for now) and saves them in the `.txt` files per day.Â 


## Why ?

For my and possibly your prototyping. Also, there is an ease of mind when there is a take home assignment to be done, so I can get quickly to the core of the problem without rushing to setup everything and wasting precious time.

The second reason is that I recently had an issue with supporting an old system that has a database with 500 tables that don't have Identity set as PK. I had to use `SQL Sequences` to achieve this (https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/26480), and I think there is really a huge gap with supporting things that do not fit the "newest and greatest" narrative.
**Sometimes you just have to support legacy, and that's it.**

## Before running the project

Nothing. Optionally, you can create a database called `BloggingDb` on your preferred database server (in my case, `localhost`).

## Run the project

1. Open `PMC console` (`Visual studio: View -> Other windows -> Package Manager Console`)
2. Type command: `Update-Database` to EF Core run migrations
3. Run the api project

# Note for 401 

This should be common knowledge, but in case someone who is a beginner in the programming world wants to run this project:
If you get a `401 Status Code`, it means you are not authorized. You can either remove the `[Authorize]` attribute on the `Controller` or login and add the bearer token to the top of the page with `Swagger`.


# Plans for future? 

I think it would be good to add some example code for the `EF Global filters` (if I figure out some logic for it - maybe publishers or something).
